# React Infinite Scroll Demo
In a recent interview I was given a coding challenge to create an infinite scroll with a generated list of words. I did not do well in the interview so this is me trying to solve it while streaming on my twitch stream [average_dev_asa](https://twitch.tv/average_dev_asa)

I've tried to recreate the boiler plate as much as I could from memory. The (ongoing) solution can be found on the solution branch.

## Running locally
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run dev`
